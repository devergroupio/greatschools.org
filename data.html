This state doesn’t publish student growth data. Instead, our Academic Progress Rating estimates student progress by comparing year-over-year test scores by grade and subject at this school compared to all schools in the state that started with similar proficiency levels. It&#39;s a helpful way to measure how well a school is helping kids learn and advance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&#39;text-align:left&#39;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/gk/ratings/#academicprogressrating&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Learn more about this rating.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

When information is missing in our display, it is because the information was not included in the data we received from the DOE.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Why are grade-level scores sometimes different from the overall score for a subject? Most likely this is due to suppression. States are required to suppress grade/subject data if the number of test-taking students is too small. This helps protect student privacy, and can mean that some grade-level scores that are part of the overall score cannot be displayed individually.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/gk/ratings/#testscoresrating&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Learn more about this rating.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Still have questions? &lt;a href=&quot;https://greatschools.zendesk.com/hc/en-us&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Visit our FAQ page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

These are comprehensive, end-of-year assessments of grade-level learning that measure progress toward college and career readiness. Each test, English language arts/literacy (ELA) and mathematics is comprised of two parts: (1) a computer adaptive test and (2) a performance task; administered within a 12-week window beginning at 66 percent of the instructional year for grades three through eight, or within in a 7-week window beginning at 80 percent of the instructional year for grade eleven. The summative assessments are aligned with the Common Core State Standards (CCSS) for ELA and mathematics. The tests capitalize on the strengths of computer adaptive testing-efficient and precise measurement across the full range of achievement and timely turnaround of results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#39;emphasis&#39;&gt;Source&lt;/span&gt;: California Department of Education, 2019&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;"

Each test, English language arts/literacy (ELA) and mathematics is comprised of two parts: (1) a computer adaptive test and (2) a performance task; administered within a 12-week window beginning at 66 percent of the instructional year for grades three through eight, or within in a 7-week window beginning at 80 percent of the instructional year for grade eleven.

I prefer this small community and great staff. This year, 2014, we have a new principal that went to school here and cares about the students more than most, as I have grown and went to LP, as did my husband, sons and grandsons, I realize that as long as you stay involved high school is the best years of your youth but, it's just 4 years and it's just high school. My sons are grown and are successful as are my grandsons, two are in college, but the social interaction and confidence are just as important as in any other school.","has_comment":true,"topic_label":"Overall experience","topic_name":"Overall","answer":"5","answer_label":null,"answer_value":"5","date_published":"August 17, 2014","id":912536,"school_id":1811,"links":{"flag":"/gsr/reviews/912536/flag"}},"topical_reviews":[],"would_recommend":null,"most_recent_date":"August 17, 2014","user_type_label":"Other (school staff, family member, recent alum, etc)","user_type":"unknown","id":1643770053407701580},{"school_user_digest":"Ugq13HYLFjo67xlHoLjp3A==","five_star_review":{"comment":"This school has a lot of academics to be offer, which makes a unique school.
